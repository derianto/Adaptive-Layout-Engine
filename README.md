Adaptive Layout Engine
----------------------

Demonstrates the ability to layout a set of contents with different sizes in a specified placeholder.

Possible algorithms:

- Dumb heuristics -> complete
- Dynamic programming -> dimensionality is too high, need agressive optimization
- A* Search
- Genetic algorithm

Possible layouting variations:

- How if we want to display a container per content, containing image, text, etc.?
- How if we want to add and delete contents dynamically?
